OPPS
- The programs which are developed by using Object Oriented Principles such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism.
- Pillars
  1. Class
  2. Object
  3. Abstraction
  4. Encapsulation
  5. Inheritance
  6. Polymorphism

Class
- Class is a collection of states and behaviour.

Object
- Object is instance of a class.
- Any entity that has a state and behaviour.
- Eg. Dog.

Encapsulation
- Binding of data members and member functions(Logical Concept).
- Practically possible using keyword 'class'.

Inheritance
- Creating new class by taking the properties of an already defined class.

Polymorphism
- Alibily to generate more than one form.

Abstraction
- Hiding internal details and showing functionality.
- Eg. Phone Call, ATM Cash Withdrawl.
- Practically achieved using 'abstract class' and 'interface'.

Constructor
- It is the initializer method used for object instantiation and object initialization.
